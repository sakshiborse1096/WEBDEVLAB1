LinkedIn 
</h1> 
<p> 
LinkedIn (/lܼŋktˈܼn/) is an American business and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites a
nd mobile apps. Launched on May 5, 2003,[5] the platform is primarily used for professional networking and career 
development, and allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015 most of the company's
revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals.[6] Since D
ecember 2016, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As of February 2022, LinkedIn has 830+ million
registered members from over 200 countries and territories.

LinkedIn allows members (both workers and employers) to create profiles and connect with each other in an online s
ocial network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an ex
isting member or not) to become a connection. LinkedIn can also be used to organize offline events, join groups, wri
te articles, publish job postings, post photos and videos, and more.[7]
